            <p>When life has cut too deep and left you hurting
                The future you had hoped for, is now burning
                And the dreams you held so tight lost their meaning
                And you don't know if you'll ever find the healing
                You're gonna make it
                You're gonna make it
                The night can only last for so long
                Whatever you're facing
                If your heart is breaking
                There's a promise for the ones who just hold on
                Lift up your eyes and see
                The sun is rising (the sun is rising)
                The sun is rising (the sun is rising)
                Every high and every low you're gonna go through
                You don't have to be afraid, I am with you (I am with you)
                In the moments you're so weak, you feel like stopping
                Let the hope you have light the road you're walking
                You're gonna make it
                You're gonna make it
                The night can only last for so long
                Whatever you're facing (whatever you're facing)
                If your heart is breaking
                There's a promise for the ones who just hold on
                Lift up your eyes and see
                The sun is rising
                And even when you can't imagine how
                How you're ever gonna find your way out
                Even when you're drabbling in your doubt
                Just look beyond the clouds
                The sun is rising
                The sun is rising
                Just look beyond the clouds
                The sun is rising
                The sun is rising
                Whatever you're facing
                If your heart is breaking
                There's a promise for the ones who just hold on
                Lift up your eyes and see
                The sun is rising
                The sun is rising
                The sun is rising (yeah)
                The sun is rising (oh)
                Yeah, yeah
                And even when you can't imagine how
                How you're ever gonna find your way out
                Even when you're drabbling in your doubt
                Just look beyond the clouds
                Even when you can't imagine how
                How you're ever gonna find your way out
                Even when you're drabbling in your doubt
                Just look beyond the clouds.</p>
